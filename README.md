# Melanoma Skin Cancer Detection
## Probelm Statement
To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution which can evaluate images and alert the dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.
The dataset consists of 2357 images of malignant and benign oncological diseases, which were formed from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC). All images were sorted according to the classification taken with ISIC, and all subsets were divided into the same number of images, with the exception of melanomas and moles, whose images are slightly dominant. The data set contains the following diseases:

1.Actinic keratosis
2.Basal cell carcinoma
3.Dermatofibroma
4.Melanoma
5.Nevus
6.Pigmented benign keratosis
7.Seborrheic keratosis
8.Squamous cell carcinoma
9.Vascular lesion
NOTE: You don't have to use any pre-trained model using Transfer learning. All the model building process should be based on a custom model.

## General Information
In cancer, there are over 200 different forms. Out of 200, melanoma is the deadliest form of skin cancer. The diagnostic procedure for melanoma starts with clinical screening, followed by dermoscopic analysis and histopathological examination. Melanoma skin cancer is highly curable if it gets identified at the early stages. The first step of Melanoma skin cancer diagnosis is to conduct a visual examination of the skin's affected area. Dermatologists take the dermatoscopic images of the skin lesions by the high-speed camera, which have an accuracy of 65-80% in the melanoma diagnosis without any additional technical support. With further visual examination by cancer treatment specialists and dermatoscopic images, the overall prediction rate of melanoma diagnosis raised to 75-84% accuracy. The project aims to build an automated classification system based on image processing techniques to classify skin cancer using skin lesions images

## Conclusions
- As per the final model (model3) Training accuracy and validation accuracy increases.
- Model overfitting issue is solved.
- Class rebalance helps in augmentation and achieving the best Training and validation accuracy.
